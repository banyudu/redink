## Search Tips

### Finding Information

**By Topic:**
- RAG: Check `RAG_TECHNOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`, `HYBRID_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- LanceDB: Check `LANCEDB_*.md` files
- Testing: Check `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- Bugs: Check `BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

**By Type:**
- Architecture: `analysis/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Quick Reference: `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- Migration Guides: Files with "MIGRATION" or "UPGRADE"
- Implementation: Files with "IMPLEMENTATION"

**By Date:**
- Check file modification dates
- Look for "Last Updated" in documents

## Common Questions

### Q: Where do I add temporary documentation?
**A:** In `.cursor/` directory, organized by type:
- Plans ‚Üí `plans/`
- Notes ‚Üí `notes/`
- Analysis ‚Üí `analysis/`

### Q: Where do I find code examples?
**A:** See [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) "Code Patterns" section

### Q: How do I understand the system architecture?
**A:** Read [PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md](./analysis/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Q: Where are the project rules?
**A:** In `.cursorrules` file at project root

### Q: How do I troubleshoot issues?
**A:** See [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) "Troubleshooting" section

### Q: Where do I find migration guides?
**A:** In `plans/` directory, look for files with "MIGRATION" or "UPGRADE"

**A:** 
1. Review similar implementations in `plans/`
2. Check patterns in `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
3. Follow conventions in `.cursorrules`
4. Document your plan in `plans/`

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review and update outdated plans
- **Monthly**: Archive completed plans (move to subdirectory)
- **Quarterly**: Update PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **As Needed**: Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md with new patterns

### Archive Strategy
When plans are completed:
1. Add "‚úÖ COMPLETED" to the top of file
2. Update final status and outcomes
3. Consider moving to `plans/archive/` subdirectory
4. Keep recent and reference plans in main directory

### Document Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Work in progress, may have TODOs
2. **Active**: Currently relevant, kept up to date
3. **Reference**: Completed but useful for reference
4. **Archive**: Historical, moved to archive subdirectory

## Contributing to Documentation

### Adding New Documents
1. Choose appropriate directory (plans, notes, analysis)
2. Use descriptive, uppercase filename with underscores
3. Include "Last Updated" date at top
4. Update this INDEX.md with new file
5. Follow template for document type

### Updating Existing Documents
1. Update "Last Updated" date
2. Note significant changes at top or in changelog section
3. Maintain consistent formatting
4. Preserve historical context

### Document Naming Conventions
- **Plans**: `FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `TECHNOLOGY_MIGRATION.md`
- **Notes**: `FEATURE_NOTES.md`, `DEBUG_SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD.md`
- **Analysis**: `COMPONENT_ANALYSIS.md`, `PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`
- Use prefixes for related files: `LANCEDB_*`, `UI_*`, etc.
