# Cursor Rules Creation Summary

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Purpose**: Document the creation of comprehensive cursor rules and documentation structure for Redink project

## What Was Created

### 1. Main Cursor Rules (`.cursorrules`)
**Location**: `/Users/banyudu/dev/yudu/redink/.cursorrules`

A comprehensive rules file containing:
- Project overview and tech stack
- Directory structure guidelines
- Code style conventions (TypeScript, React, Rust)
- Component patterns (Singleton, Zustand, Tauri)
- Best practices (Performance, Security, Offline-First)
- File organization rules
- **Temporary file location policy** (all in `.cursor/`)
- Common patterns and examples
- AI assistant guidelines

### 2. Supporting Documentation

#### .cursor/README.md
- Overview of `.cursor/` directory purpose
- Directory structure explanation
- File organization guidelines
- What belongs (and doesn't belong) in this directory
- Maintenance guidelines
- Current contents listing

#### .cursor/INDEX.md
- Navigation hub for all documentation
- Quick links to key documents
- Documentation categories
- Search tips and common questions
- Document templates and naming conventions
- Maintenance schedule

#### .cursor/QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Common commands (development, package management, Rust)
- Code patterns with examples
- File locations reference
- Troubleshooting guide
- Quick checks before committing
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Links to official documentation

#### .cursor/analysis/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Complete system architecture documentation
- High-level architecture diagrams
- Frontend and backend architecture details
- Data flow explanations
- Vector store architecture
- RAG implementation details
- PDF processing pipeline
- Storage architecture
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Future enhancements roadmap

### 3. Directory Structure
Created organized subdirectories:
```
.cursor/
├── analysis/        # System analysis and architecture
├── notes/          # Development notes
└── plans/          # Implementation plans (already existed)
```

## Key Features of the Cursor Rules

### 1. Comprehensive Tech Stack Coverage
- ✅ React 18 + TypeScript 5.6 patterns
- ✅ Tauri 2 integration guidelines
- ✅ LanceDB 0.22.2 usage patterns
- ✅ Rust conventions and Tauri commands
- ✅ shadcn/ui component patterns
- ✅ Zustand state management
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 styling

### 2. Clear Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- Naming conventions (files, components, functions)
- Import alias usage (`@/*`)
- Error handling patterns
- Console logging with contextual prefixes
- Documentation requirements (JSDoc)

### 3. Component Patterns
- Singleton service pattern
- Zustand store pattern
- Tauri command pattern
- shadcn/ui component structure
- Loading state pattern
- Vector store usage examples

### 4. Temporary File Policy
**CRITICAL RULE**: All temporary files MUST be in `.cursor/` directory:
- Plans → `.cursor/plans/`
- Notes → `.cursor/notes/`
- Analysis → `.cursor/analysis/`
- **Never** create `.md` files in project root (except permanent docs)

### 5. Best Practices
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Security considerations
- Offline-first architecture principles
- Error handling standards
- Testing strategy (future)

## Project Analysis Summary

### Project Type
Redink - Desktop application for managing and chatting with ArXiv papers using local LLM models

### Key Characteristics
1. **Offline-First**: All critical features work without network
2. **Type-Safe**: Strong typing in both TypeScript and Rust
3. **Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
4. **RAG-Powered**: Hybrid semantic + keyword search
5. **Local ML**: Browser-based embeddings via @xenova/transformers
6. **Vector Storage**: LanceDB for efficient similarity search

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3, TypeScript 5.6, Vite 6.0
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri 2), LanceDB 0.22.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.8, shadcn/ui
- **State**: Zustand 4.5 with persistence
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **i18n**: i18next + react-i18next
- **PDF**: pdfjs-dist 5.3.93, react-pdf 10.1
- **ML**: @xenova/transformers 2.17.2

### Recent Major Updates
1. ✅ Migrated from MUI to Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
2. ✅ Upgraded LanceDB to 0.22.2 with Arrow 56.2
3. ✅ Implemented hybrid RAG (semantic + keyword)
4. ✅ Rust-based vector store implementation

## How to Use These Rules

### For AI Assistants
1. Read `.cursorrules` at project start
2. Follow all conventions and patterns
3. **Always** place temporary files in `.cursor/` directory
4. Use provided patterns for new code
5. Maintain type safety across TS-Rust boundary
6. Consider offline-first architecture

### For Developers
1. Review `.cursorrules` to understand project conventions
2. Use `.cursor/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for daily work
3. Refer to `.cursor/analysis/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for system understanding
4. Check `.cursor/plans/` for implementation guides
5. Follow naming and organizational conventions

### For New Team Members
1. Start with `README.md` (project root)
2. Read `.cursorrules` for conventions
3. Review `.cursor/INDEX.md` for navigation
4. Study `.cursor/analysis/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. Check `.cursor/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for patterns
6. Browse `.cursor/plans/` for recent work
