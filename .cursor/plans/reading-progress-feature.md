# Reading Progress Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic reading progress tracking for PDF files. The feature saves scroll position and current page for each PDF, and automatically restores it when reopening.

## Changes Made

### 1. Store Updates (`src/store/index.ts`)

Added new interface and state:
```typescript
export interface ReadingProgress {
  scrollTop: number;
  scrollLeft: number;
  currentPage: number;
  lastUpdated: number;
}
```

New state properties:
- `readingProgress: Record<string, ReadingProgress>` - Stores progress for each file path
- `setReadingProgress(filePath, progress)` - Save progress for a file
- `getReadingProgress(filePath)` - Retrieve saved progress

All reading progress is automatically persisted via Zustand's persist middleware.

### 2. PDFViewer Updates (`src/components/PDFViewer.tsx`)

#### New State & Refs
- `currentPage` - Tracks the currently visible page number
- `scrollContainerRef` - Reference to the scrollable container
- `saveProgressTimeoutRef` - For debounced progress saving
- `hasRestoredProgressRef` - Ensures progress is only restored once per file

#### New Functions

**`saveProgress(scrollTop, scrollLeft, page)`**
- Debounced function (500ms) to save reading progress
- Prevents excessive updates during rapid scrolling
- Saves to Zustand store with timestamp

**`detectCurrentPage(container)`**
- Calculates which page is currently visible
- Uses center of viewport to determine closest page
- Reads `data-page-number` attributes from page elements

**`handleScroll(event)`**
- Attached to scroll container
- Updates current page state
- Triggers debounced progress saving

#### Restoration Logic
- Automatically restores scroll position after PDF loads
- Uses 100ms delay to ensure pages are rendered
- Only restores once per file opening
- Resets restoration flag when file changes

#### UI Updates
- Toolbar now shows "Page X of Y" instead of just total pages
- Added `data-page-number` attribute to each page container for tracking
- Scroll event listener attached to container

## How It Works

1. **Tracking**: As user scrolls, the component:
   - Detects current visible page based on viewport center
   - Updates UI to show current page
   - Saves scroll position and page number (debounced)

2. **Persistence**: 
   - Progress is stored in Zustand with file path as key
   - Automatically persisted to localStorage
   - Includes timestamp for potential future use

3. **Restoration**:
   - When PDF loads, checks for saved progress
   - If found, waits for pages to render (100ms)
   - Restores exact scroll position and updates page counter
   - Logs restoration to console for debugging

## Key Features

- ✅ Automatic tracking without user intervention
- ✅ Debounced saving to avoid performance issues
- ✅ Accurate page detection based on viewport
- ✅ Persisted across app restarts
- ✅ Per-file tracking (unique to each PDF path)
- ✅ Visual feedback (current page in toolbar)
- ✅ Smooth restoration without jarring jumps

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: 500ms delay prevents excessive storage writes
- **Passive Listeners**: Scroll events use `{ passive: true }` for better performance
- **Refs for Cleanup**: Properly clears timeouts on unmount

### Edge Cases Handled
- Multiple files: Each file has independent progress
- File changes: Progress resets and restores for new file
- No saved progress: Works normally without errors
- Rapid scrolling: Debouncing ensures stable behavior

## Testing Recommendations

1. Open a PDF and scroll to middle/end
2. Close and reopen the same PDF
3. Verify it scrolls to the last position
4. Test with multiple different PDFs
5. Verify page counter updates correctly while scrolling
6. Test after app restart to ensure persistence

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add "Jump to Page" input in toolbar
- Show thumbnail preview of pages
- Add bookmarks feature
- Sync progress across devices
- Show reading time statistics
