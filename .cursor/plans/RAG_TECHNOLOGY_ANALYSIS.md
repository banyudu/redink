## Current Implementation Analysis

### What You Have Now

**Technology Stack:**
- **Chunking**: Fixed-size character-based chunking (1200 chars, 200 overlap)
- **Retrieval**: TF-IDF with cosine similarity
- **Embedding**: None (keyword-based)
- **Storage**: In-memory JavaScript Maps
- **LLM Integration**: Direct API calls to Ollama/OpenAI

**Strengths:**
✅ Zero external dependencies (pure TypeScript)  
✅ No network calls for embeddings  
✅ Fast startup time  
✅ Small bundle size  
✅ Works offline completely  
✅ Simple to understand and debug  

**Weaknesses:**
❌ No semantic understanding (only keyword matching)  
❌ Misses synonyms and paraphrased queries  
❌ Poor recall for concept-based questions  
❌ No advanced chunking strategies (ignores document structure)  
❌ Cannot handle multi-document knowledge graphs  
❌ Limited to ~3 chunks context (token limits)  

**Example Failure Cases:**
- Query: "What machine learning techniques were used?" 
- TF-IDF might miss chunks discussing "neural networks" or "deep learning" if those exact terms aren't in the query
- Semantic search would understand these are related concepts

## RAG Technology Options

### Option 1: Local Vector Embeddings + Vector Database

**Description**: Replace TF-IDF with semantic embeddings using local models, store in a vector database.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Embeddings**: 
  - `transformers.js` (in-browser ML)
  - `onnxruntime-web` + sentence-transformers models
  - Models: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (22MB), `gte-small` (33MB)
- **Vector Store**: 
  - `vectra` (local TypeScript vector DB)
  - `chromadb` (client-server option)
  - `hnswlib-node` (Node.js only, very fast)

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Pseudo-code
import { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers';

const embedder = await pipeline('feature-extraction', 'Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2');
const chunks = chunkText(pdfText);
const embeddings = await Promise.all(
  chunks.map(chunk => embedder(chunk.text))
);
// Store in Vectra
const index = new Vectra();
await index.insertItems(chunks.map((chunk, i) => ({
  id: chunk.id,
  vector: embeddings[i],
  metadata: { text: chunk.text }
})));

// Query
const queryEmbedding = await embedder(question);
const results = await index.queryItems(queryEmbedding, 5);
```

**Pros:**
✅ Semantic understanding (finds concepts, not just keywords)  
✅ Still works offline  
✅ No API costs for embeddings  
✅ Can run entirely in Tauri app  
✅ Models downloaded once and cached  
✅ Better recall for paraphrased queries  
✅ Can implement hybrid search (TF-IDF + semantic)  

**Cons:**
❌ Larger bundle size (+20-40MB for models)  
❌ Initial model download time  
❌ Slower embedding generation (CPU-bound)  
❌ Memory usage increases with document size  
❌ WebAssembly performance limitations  
❌ Need to manage model updates  

**Best For:** Desktop apps where 20-40MB is acceptable, users want offline capability

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Bundle Size Impact:** +25-40MB  
**Runtime Performance:** 100-500ms per query (CPU dependent)

  - Cohere `embed-english-v3.0` (free tier available)
  - Voyage AI `voyage-2` ($0.01/1M tokens)
- **Vector Store**: Local (Vectra, IndexedDB with custom similarity search)

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

async function embedText(text: string) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
      input: text
    })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.data[0].embedding;
}
```

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 3-5 days  
**Bundle Size Impact:** +2-5MB  
**Scalability:** Excellent for complex features

---

### Option 5: Hybrid Approach (TF-IDF + Semantic)

**Description**: Combine your existing TF-IDF with semantic search for best of both worlds.

**Technology Stack:**
- Keep current TF-IDF implementation
- Add lightweight semantic layer (transformers.js)
- Fuse results using reciprocal rank fusion

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Keep existing TF-IDF
const tfidfResults = retrieveTFIDF(index, question, 10);

// Add semantic search
const embedding = await embedder(question);
const semanticResults = await vectorStore.query(embedding, 10);

// Fuse results (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
const fused = fuseResults(tfidfResults, semanticResults, {
  tfidfWeight: 0.4,
  semanticWeight: 0.6
});

return fused.slice(0, 5); // Top 5 combined
```

**Pros:**
✅ Best of both worlds  
✅ TF-IDF catches exact term matches  
✅ Semantic catches concept matches  
✅ Can fallback to TF-IDF if embedding fails  
✅ Gradual migration path  
✅ Research shows hybrid often outperforms either alone  
✅ Minimal code changes initially  

**Cons:**
❌ More complex to tune (two systems)  
❌ Increased maintenance  
❌ Need to balance weights  
❌ Slower than single method  
❌ Bundle size includes both systems  

**Best For:** Want to improve gradually, scientific papers benefit from both approaches

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 3-4 days  
**Bundle Size Impact:** +25-35MB  
**Performance:** Best retrieval quality

---

### Option 6: Advanced Chunking Strategies

**Description**: Improve chunking before considering other changes. Often the highest ROI improvement.

**Strategies:**
1. **Semantic Chunking**: Split at natural boundaries (sentences, paragraphs)
2. **Hierarchical Chunking**: Parent-child relationships (section → paragraph → sentence)
3. **Structure-Aware**: Parse PDF structure (titles, sections, figures, tables)
4. **Sliding Window with Larger Context**: Retrieve small chunks but provide larger context to LLM
5. **Proposition-Based**: Break content into atomic claims/propositions

**Implementation Ideas:**
```typescript
// Semantic Chunking
import nlp from 'compromise';
const doc = nlp(text);
const sentences = doc.sentences().out('array');
const chunks = groupIntoParagraphs(sentences, targetSize);

// Hierarchical
const sections = extractSections(pdf); // Title, abstract, intro, etc.
const hierarchicalChunks = sections.map(section => ({
  parent: section.title,
  children: chunkText(section.content, 500, 50)
}));

// When retrieving, include parent context
```

**Pros:**
✅ High ROI (often 20-40% improvement)  
✅ Works with any retrieval method  
✅ Better context preservation  
✅ Captures document structure  
✅ Can include metadata (section, page number)  
✅ No ML models needed  

**Cons:**
❌ PDF structure parsing is hard  
❌ Papers have inconsistent formatting  
❌ Requires careful tuning  
❌ More complex code  

**Best For:** Should do this regardless of other choices

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 2-4 days  
**Bundle Size Impact:** +0-200KB  
**Performance Improvement:** 20-40% better context quality

---

### Option 7: Re-Ranking Layer

**Description**: Retrieve more candidates (e.g., 20), then use a re-ranker model to select best 3-5.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Models**: Cross-encoders (more accurate than bi-encoders for ranking)
  - Cohere Re-rank API
  - `jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en`
  - Local cross-encoder models
- **Pattern**: Retrieve → Re-rank → Use top results

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Retrieve more candidates
const candidates = await retrieve(index, question, 20); // 20 instead of 3

// Step 2: Re-rank with cross-encoder
const reranked = await rerank({
  query: question,
  documents: candidates.map(c => c.chunk.text),
  model: 'rerank-english-v2.0'
});

// Step 3: Use top results
const topChunks = reranked.slice(0, 3);
```

**Pros:**
✅ Significantly improves precision  
✅ Catches subtle relevance signals  
✅ Works with any retrieval method  
✅ Can be added as final step  
✅ Cohere has free tier  

**Cons:**
❌ Additional API call/latency  
❌ Increased cost  
❌ Local re-rankers are large (100MB+)  
❌ More complex pipeline  

**Best For:** When precision is critical, can afford API costs

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Cost:** ~$0.002 per query (Cohere)  
**Performance Improvement:** 15-30% better precision

---

### Option 8: Multi-Query / Query Transformation

**Description**: Transform user query into multiple variations before retrieval, then merge results.

**Strategies:**
1. **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**: Generate hypothetical answer, embed and search
2. **Multi-Query**: Generate 3-5 variations of question
3. **Step-back Prompting**: Generate broader question, then specific
4. **Query Decomposition**: Break complex questions into sub-questions

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Generate query variations
const queryVariations = await llm.complete(`
Generate 3 different ways to ask this question, focusing on different aspects:
"${question}"

1.
2.
3.
`);

// Retrieve for each variation
const allResults = await Promise.all(
  queryVariations.map(q => retrieve(index, q, 5))
);

// Merge and deduplicate
const merged = mergeResults(allResults);
```

**Pros:**
✅ Handles ambiguous queries better  
✅ Improves recall  
✅ Catches different aspects of question  
✅ Works with any retrieval backend  

**Cons:**
❌ More LLM calls (cost/latency)  
❌ Complex merging logic  
❌ Can retrieve too much irrelevant content  

**Best For:** Complex analytical questions, research-focused usage

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Additional Cost:** +1-2 LLM calls per query
