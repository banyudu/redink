# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Release Workflow

This is your 5-minute guide to setting up automated releases for Redink.

## âœ… Prerequisites Checklist

Before you start, make sure you have:
- [x] GitHub repository with write access
- [x] macOS machine (for building DMG files)
- [x] Node.js and pnpm installed
- [x] Rust toolchain installed
- [ ] OpenSSL installed (`brew install openssl` if not present)

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Generate Signing Keys (2 min)

```bash
bash scripts/generate-keys.sh
```

**Expected Output**: You'll see a public key in base64 format. Copy it!

### Step 2: Update Configuration (1 min)

Open `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and find this line:

```json
"pubkey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE` with the public key you copied.

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secret (2 min)

1. Go to: https://github.com/banyudu/redink/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
4. Value: Run `cat ~/.tauri/redink.key` and paste the entire output
5. Click "Add secret"

### Step 4: Commit & Push

```bash
git add src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
git commit -m "chore: configure updater with signing key"
git push
```

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

Now you can create releases. Here's how:

### Create Your First Release

```bash
# 1. Draft the release
pnpm release:draft
# When prompted, enter: 1.0.0

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push && git push --tags

# 3. Wait ~10 minutes for build

# 4. Go to https://github.com/banyudu/redink/releases
#    and publish the draft release
```

## ðŸ“± Test the Update System

After your first release is published:

1. Build the app locally: `pnpm tauri build`
2. Open the app
3. Go to Settings â†’ App Updates
4. Click "Check for Updates"
5. You should see "You're up to date!" (since you're on the latest)

To test actual updates:
1. Create a new release (version 1.0.1)
2. Run your local app (still version 1.0.0)
3. Check for updates - you'll see an update dialog!

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: openssl"
```bash
brew install openssl
```

### "Permission denied" when running script
```bash
chmod +x scripts/generate-keys.sh
bash scripts/generate-keys.sh
```

### Build fails on GitHub Actions
- Check that you added the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret
- Verify the public key in `tauri.conf.json` matches your private key

### Updates not working
- Ensure the release is published (not draft)
- Check that `latest.json` exists in the release assets
- Verify the endpoint URL in `tauri.conf.json` is correct

## ðŸ“š More Information

- **Quick Reference**: [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md)
- **Detailed Setup**: [RELEASE_SETUP.md](RELEASE_SETUP.md)
- **Technical Docs**: [../.cursor/plans/release-workflow-setup.md](../.cursor/plans/release-workflow-setup.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Release

For subsequent releases, just:

```bash
pnpm release:draft    # Enter new version
git push --tags       # Push to trigger build
```

That's it! GitHub Actions handles everything else automatically.
