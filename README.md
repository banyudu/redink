# Redink

A modern desktop application for managing and chatting with ArXiv papers using local LLM models.

## Download & Installation

### For End Users

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/banyudu/redink/releases/latest).

#### macOS Installation

⚠️ **Important**: You will see a **"Redink is damaged"** error on first launch. This is normal for unsigned apps.

**Quick Fix (Recommended)**:
```bash
# After downloading, run in Terminal:
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/Redink*.dmg
# After installing to Applications:
xattr -cr /Applications/Redink.app
```

**Alternative - System Settings**:
1. Try to open Redink (it will fail with an error)
2. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the Redink warning
4. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

**Why this happens**: Redink is not notarized with Apple (requires $99/year developer account). The app is safe to use - this is just macOS Gatekeeper protecting against unsigned apps.

#### Helper Script

Download `install-helper.sh` from the releases page and run:
```bash
bash install-helper.sh
```

This interactive script will automatically fix the Gatekeeper issue for you.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: "Redink is damaged and can't be opened"

This is a false positive from macOS Gatekeeper. See the [Installation section](#macos-installation) above for fixes.

**To check detailed logs**:
```bash
# Launch from terminal to see errors
/Applications/Redink.app/Contents/MacOS/Redink

# Or watch system logs
log stream --predicate 'process == "Redink"' --level debug
```

### macOS: App won't open after fixing quarantine

Try:
1. Right-click on Redink.app → **Open** (not just double-click)
2. Check Console.app for error messages
3. Verify quarantine is removed: `xattr /Applications/Redink.app`
